## Education, Lifelong Learning & Technologies I'm Excited About
I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and am constantly trying to expand my technical and conceptual abilities. I see new techonolgies and ideas as a way to expand my skill sets and not as threats to them.

- Working towards a Bachelor’s in Information Technology/Web Development from American Public University (online, currently enrolled but not attending classes).  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - I am currently using Docker to create all of my development environments. It's so cool that a file in version control can set up the entire environment which will run the app!
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - An amazing PHP framework which makes coding web applications fun, intuitive and _way_ easier to maintain!
- [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/about/)
- Raspberry Pi/Arduino - I've got a couple fun projects under my belt and ideas for more! They're like toys for adults.

## Hobbies, Talents, Volunteer Work & Things I Want to Brag About
- Volunteer Thursday evenings at [Code for Fort Collins](http://codeforfoco.org), a non-profit community-based software development organization.
- I've been jammin on my guitar since I was 11.
- I make a great mushroom risotto.
- I have two dogs:
